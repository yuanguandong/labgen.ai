> Turn AI images into reusable prompts.

Labgen is a practical **image-to-prompt** tool that helps creators, designers, and AI artists
reverse-engineer prompts from images instead of guessing from scratch.

## Why Labgen?

If you use **Midjourney**, **Nano Banana**, **Seedream**, or other AI image models,
you’ve probably experienced this:

- You see an amazing AI-generated image
- You save it for inspiration
- But you have no idea how the prompt was written

Prompting is a learnable skill — but guessing prompts is not how people actually learn.

Labgen is built around a simple idea:

> **The fastest way to learn prompts is to reverse-engineer real images.**

## What Labgen Does

Labgen analyzes an image and generates a **structured, reusable prompt** that you can:

- Study to understand prompt structure
- Reuse as a starting point
- Modify and iterate for your own creations

It focuses on **clarity and usefulness**, not generic descriptions.

## More Than One Tool

While image-to-prompt is the core feature, Labgen is evolving into a small collection of
**focused AI tools for creators**.

Each tool follows the same principles:
- One clear purpose
- Minimal UI
- Practical workflows
- No unnecessary complexity

Labgen is not trying to be an “everything AI platform” —
it’s a growing toolbox built for real use.

## Who Is This For?

Labgen is useful if you are:

- Learning AI image generation
- Studying prompt structures
- Using models like Midjourney, Nano Banana, or Seedream
- Trying to recreate styles consistently
- Iterating on visual ideas faster

You don’t need to be an expert — beginners often benefit the most.

---

## How to Use

1. Find an AI-generated image you like
2. Go to https://labgen.ai

## Philosophy

Prompting is not magic.

It’s closer to:
- Design systems
- Writing frameworks
- Photographic composition

Labgen exists to make prompt structure **visible and understandable**.
